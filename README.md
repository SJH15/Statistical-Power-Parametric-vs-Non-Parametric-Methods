# Statistical-Power-Parametric-vs-Non-Parametric-Methods
 A simulation-based comparison of t-tests, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney, and Siegel-Tukey tests using R.

Project Overview

This project replicates and extends a published study comparing the effectiveness of parametric and non-parametric statistical tests when applied to non-normally distributed data. Using R, I simulated datasets and tested the statistical power of the t-test, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (WMW) test, and Siegel-Tukey test under various conditions.

🎯 Objectives

Replicate Table 3 from Vickers (2005) using simulated data in R

Compare statistical power of t-tests vs WMW across different sample sizes and correlations

Introduce the Siegel-Tukey test and analyze its comparative power

🔍 Key Results

WMW outperformed t-tests at low sample sizes and low correlation values

T-tests became more powerful with large sample sizes and high correlations

Siegel-Tukey test was generally less powerful, confirming its limited usefulness in these contexts

🛠 Tools & Techniques

R (data simulation, loops, and hypothesis testing)

Power calculation methods

ggplot2 for heatmaps and data visualization
